          <li>
            <b>(a) Information You Provide</b><br>
            GetCeleb may collect personal information from you when you:
            <p>i.    Create an account on the Site: GetCeleb collects your name and email address and may collect other personal information, such as a telephone number when you register, update, or add information to your account. We require you to create a user name and password for your account. GetCeleb collects personal information relating to any third-party account that you link to your GetCeleb account (such as your gmail user name if you link your gmail account). We use this information to maintain your account and communicate with you about the account, such as by verifying your email address or account information or requesting you to respond to a survey to improve the user experience on our Site. We will use your email address to send you promotional email communications from GetCeleb (and not from any third party) if you have opted in to receive them; to stop receiving them, click on the “unsubscribe” link in the footer of the promotional email.</p>
            <p>ii.   Make a purchase through the Site: GetCeleb collects the information that you provide when requesting a GETCELEB video, including your name and email address, any mobile phone contact number (of you or the recipient) you choose to provide, the name of the recipient, and the details that you provide as part of your request. GetCeleb processes payment information you provide when you pay for a purchase. When you purchase merchandise, we also collect shipping and delivery information. When ordering a GETCELEB video, unless you opt-out, we will make your name, the recipient’s name, and the GETCELEB video itself public on our Site. We use this information to fulfill your request, accept your payment, ship and deliver your orders, deliver email messages, and process information you provide through our Site. We process information of designated recipients that you provide to us to the extent necessary to provide the GETCELEB video, either as part of the content or for the transaction itself (for example, we share the recipient’s name and the details of the request with the GetCeleb talent). </p>
            <p>iii.  Contact Customer Service through info@getceleb.in. GetCeleb collects personal and other information in connection with providing customer service. We use this information to provide you and others with customer service, to assist in resolving issues, and to evaluate and improve our customer service and processes.</p>
            <p>
              iv.  Provide Content to the Site. Our Site may permit you to submit content to us, such as a video, review, photo, email, text, social media post, or other communication (each, a “Submission”) and our Site permits Talent to submit content and data (“Talent Content”). Any Submission, whether submitted to our Site directly or through a Social Media Platform, and any Talent Content, is subject to the applicable Terms of Service, which gives GetCeleb certain rights to use it. Some of your personal information, such as your name, user name, or where you reside, may be publicly displayed. Others may access it, use it, and share it.
            </p>
            <p>
              v.   Use the Site as a Talent User. When you use our Site to become or as a “Talent User,” we collect your name, email address, phone number, and the social media user names you provide, GETCELEB videos prepared by you, and other information relating to our relationship with you, such as payment records. We use this information to offer GETCELEB videos to our users, connect you with them, assist with the payment transaction, and manage our relationship with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              vi.  Use the Site as a GetCeleb Partner. When you use our Site to become or as a “GetCeleb Partner,” we collect your name, email address, phone number, and other information relating to our relationship with you, including payment information. GetCeleb’s payments to you are made through the payment provider selected by GetCeleb, which is a Third Party Property. You should review the payment provider’s privacy policy before providing your personal information.
